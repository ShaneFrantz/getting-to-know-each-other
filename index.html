<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Hello! My name is Shane Frantz. I am a Computer Science Major at Lewis University! I have two sisters, one works in a restaurant, and one is a music teacher.
<br>In my free time, I work at Panera Bread and sing in both a barbershop quartet and chorus.</br>
<br>My quartet, Freelance, will be competing at the Illinois State Championships in just a few weeks. We are currently ranked #4 in the state of Illinois!</br>

<h2>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">
As mentioned previously, I love to sing. I sing in a chorus called New Tradition, based in Northbrook, IL. I also sing in a barbershop quartet called Freelance. I have been lucky enough to compete at two World Championships. My quartet, Optimum placed 18th in the Youth division last year in Charlotte, and my chorus just placed 33rd this year in Louisville.
<br>I have been singing ever since I was a kid, and have always loved both singing and listening to older styles of music.</br>
<br>I don't really have any big influences when it comes to my vocal style. My goal is to be as original and unique as possible.</br>
