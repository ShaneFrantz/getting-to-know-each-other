<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">Hello! My name is Shane Frantz. I am a Computer Science Major at Lewis University! I have two sisters, one works in a restaurant, and one is a music teacher.
<br>In my free time, I work at Panera Bread, play online poker, and sing in both a barbershop quartet and chorus.</br>
<br>My chorus will be competing at the world championships in July, and my quartet is currently waiting to see if we have also qualified!</br>

<h2>My Favorite Hobby / Activity</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px">
As mentioned previously, I love to sing. I sing in a chorus called New Tradition, based in Northbrook, IL. I also sing in a barbershop quartet called Optimum, with members from Massachusetts, Florida, and Georgia.
<br>I have been singing ever since I was a kid, and have always loved both singing and listening to older styles of music.</br>
<br>I don't really have any big influences when it comes to my vocal style. My goal is to be as original and unique as possible.</br>
